## Kiosk mode escape

When facing a device in public places or used for a very specific purpose there is the case that it is set up in kiosk mode. There are both Linux and Windows based kiosk configurations. First thing to do is to check if there is any kind of port available on the device. Secondly, both OS and browser shortcuts should be checked upon in order to escape the kiosk default front screen. Very useful resources are the following:
